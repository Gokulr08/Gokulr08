Hey, Haii  
I'm Gokul, and I work at TCS

Right now, I am coding Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) on websites like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and CodeChef. I'm not a pro yet, but I'm working on it

I am also working on different projects and freelancing on Upwork, taking all type of projects to learn new things and improve. I am thinking about becoming a Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or maybe a Software Developer.

I play chess, with a current ELO of 500. My short goal is to reach 1000 Soon, I plan to join the TN Chess Association and start playing in tournaments. In my free time, I like reading books and want to make a book cupboard in my room. I also play badminton and I have just started learning Hindi, both writing and reading.

Something special about me: I always try to learn something new or stay interested in new things
