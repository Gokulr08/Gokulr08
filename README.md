Hey, Hi!
I'm Gokul, and I work at TCS.

Right now, I am coding Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) on websites like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and CodeChef. I'm not a pro yet, bt I'm working on it.

I am also working on different projects and freelancing, taking all types of projects to learn new things and improve.

I play chess, with a current ELO of 500. My short-term goal is to reach 1000 soon (if you want to play with me, just email me, and I'll send a challenge link). Maybe I plan to join the TN Chess Association and start playing in tournaments(not sure üòÖ).... In my free time, I do reading books (i like to keep my cupboard full of books). I also play badminton and have just started learning Hindi, both writing and reading.

I also keep a journal where I write about myself, experiences, dailylife, and how I‚Äôm growing.ü§µüèªüñ§...
