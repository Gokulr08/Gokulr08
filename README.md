Hey, Hi!  
I'm Gokul, and I work at TCS.

Right now, I am coding Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) on websites like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and CodeChef. I'm not a pro yet, but I'm working on it.

I am also working on different projects and freelancing, taking all types of projects to learn new things and improve.  
Currently, I am working on an **Expense Tracking System** project.

I play chess, with a current ELO of 500. My short-term goal is to reach 1000 soon. If you want to challenge me, you can do so from this [link](https://chess.com/play/Gokul21r). Maybe I plan to join the TN Chess Association and start playing in tournaments (not sure üòÖ)....

Sometimes, I do reading books (I like to keep my cupboard full of books). I also play badminton and have just started learning Hindi, both writing and reading.

I also keep a journal where I write about myself, experiences, and daily life ü§µüèªüñ§...
